## 3. Problem Statement
Finding affordable flats and suitable roommates is a major challenge for university students, especially in new cities. Existing solutions are scattered, unreliable, and often lack essential details like location, facilities, and verified profiles. This leads to wasted time, higher living costs, and mismatched roommates.

## 4. Proposed Solution / Idea
A mobile application exclusively for university students to find and share flats. The app will provide verified listings with details like location, rent, facilities, and number of roommates. Students can post vacancies, search for available flats, filter results, and directly contact potential roommates through an in-app messaging system.

## 5. Key Features
- Verified student profiles (university email authentication)
- Detailed flat listings with rent, location, and facilities
- Google Maps integration for location viewing
- Search & filter by rent, facilities, and location
- In-app chat for direct communication
- Option to post and manage your own listings

## 6. Target Users / Audience
